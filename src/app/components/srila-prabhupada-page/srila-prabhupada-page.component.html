        His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, commonly known as Srila Prabhupada, the founder of the
        Hare Krishna movement, is an empowered messenger of God who appeared in this world to help us reawaken to our
        spiritual identity. He had a special mandate from his spiritual teacher to bring the eternal spiritual truths of
        Krishna consciousness, contained in the Vedic scriptures of India, to the Western world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Srila Prabhupada accepted this daunting task and made it his life's mission. At the advanced age of 70 years,
        he came to the United States with no assistants and no money. He depended fully on the mercy of Lord Krishna and
        was able to persevere where others had failed.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a tiny storefront in the East Village of New York City, Srila Prabhupada started the International Society
        for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) in 1966. From 1966 to 1977 Srila Prabhupada preached vigorously all over the
        world, opening more than 100 centres and introducing Krishna consciousness to millions of people. He also
        translated and published many spiritual books and encouraged their distribution.

        We get a glimpse of Srila Prabhupada's elevated and empowered spiritual position from the lasting effect he has
        had in changing the lives of so many.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since his departure from this world in 1977, his disciples have carried on his mission. It is their desire that
        his legacy will some day be more widely appreciated by the masses, as well as the leaders of the world.
